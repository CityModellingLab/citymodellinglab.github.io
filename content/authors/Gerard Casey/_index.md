I am a transport modeller and data scientist working at the intersection of research, policy, and real-world decision making. My work focuses on developing and applying large-scale, high-resolution agent-based models to better understand how cities function, how people move, and how policy and infrastructure interventions shape social, environmental, and economic outcomes.

I currently lead research and development in city and transport modelling, with a particular emphasis on urban mobility, decarbonisation, equity, and sustainability. My research combines novel data sources—including real-time and sensor-derived datasets—with scalable simulation techniques to represent complex human behaviour and system interactions at city and national scales. Much of my work involves designing modelling frameworks that can move beyond traditional appraisal approaches, enabling evidence-based exploration of uncertainty, distributional impacts, and long-term transitions.

I am motivated by the use of modelling as a tool for enlightenment rather than post-justification. This means building transparent, testable methods that help decision-makers understand trade-offs, unintended consequences, and who benefits or loses from different policy choices. My work spans both academic research and applied consultancy, with methods developed through research now informing live policy decisions across transport, land use, energy, and climate change.

Alongside my applied work, I collaborate closely with academic partners, supervise doctoral research, and contribute to methodological guidance and standards. My ambition is to help shape a new generation of urban modelling tools that support fair, data-driven pathways to decarbonised and inclusive cities.
